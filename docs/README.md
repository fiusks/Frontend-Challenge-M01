# My Portfolio
It was my first challenge of Cubos Academy Full Stack Course. The project goal was to create a portfolio like landing page with HTML and CSS only.

## Goal
My objective with this aplication is to use it as a real portfolio page and share all the challenges that I've done during the course. They are in a private repository and that is the reason why I'm rebuilding them. It's also an opportunity to review my codes and optmize them.

## The code
It is a second version of the original challenge. After the end of the course, I rebuild the app using react and implemented some new features. You can find the original layout in the figma file.

### New Features

- Contact form validation using Formik and Yup
- Sending email from contact page using the service of EmailJs
- Translated pages for two languages (pt-br / en-us) using i18next
- Elements transformed into reusable components in React
- Responsive layout using Bootstrap 5
- CSS optimization using SASS

### Refactoring

During the refactoration I made some modifications in the navigation system where I've changed from <a> links to hooks using useNavigate from react-router-dom

All the CSS was refactored for SASS that is more efficient and makes the code cleaner
  
Some elements that were repetaed in the original project, were remade using the component logic from React

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
